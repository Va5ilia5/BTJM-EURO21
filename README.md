### This repository is for the project I've done on the possible finalist for the UEFA EURO2021. 

The following are some of the data techniques I used in the project:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Wrangling
- Data Cleaning
- Data Mining
- Practical Statistics (i.e. applying inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, like analyzing A/B tests.)
- SQL for Data Analysis
- Data Visualization to draw meaningful conclusions

### Technical Skills utilized
* Python
* Data Analysis/Wrangling libraries (Numpy, Pandas)
* Data Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Microsoft Excel
* Jupyter Notebooks
* SQL
